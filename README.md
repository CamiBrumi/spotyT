## Some kind of schedule
april 10 more feature engineering and merge data
questions
1 time signature only the numerator?
2 Keys: minor major problem

april 11: maybe a bit more on feature engineering and merging data, correlations and choosing the predictors- backwards/forward/best subset/pca
april 12- 16 we can do the K-NN, LDA, QDA, logistic regression
april 17 - 19 cross validation/ play with the models, compute accuracy, maybe 
april 21-23 INTERFACE CONTINENTS AND RANKINGS

*Notes* : at some point we will have to do the separation of the training set from the testing set

## Datasets

## How to get started
1. Look at the datasets -> take out the data we don't want
2. Use R to see relationships, find correlations, choose the best predictors
3. ???
4. Profit
