Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0. 

## Key
Unit circle divided into 12

C Major = A Minor = (1,0)
C# Major = A# Minor = (sqrt(3)/2, 1/2)
D Major = B Minor = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2)
D# Major = C Minor = (0,1)
E Major = C# Minor = (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2)
F Major = D Minor = (-sqrt(3)/2), 1/2)
F# Major = D# Minor = (-1,0)
G Major = E Minor = (-sqrt(3)/2), -1/2)
G# Major = F Minor = (-1/2, -sqrt(3)/2)
A Major = F# Minor = (0,-1)
A# Major = G Minor = (1/2, -sqrt(3)/2)
B Major = G# Minor = (sqrt(3)/2), -1/2)

## Liveness
Value between 0.0 and 1.0

A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.

## Loudness
in decibels (dB)
Values typicaly range between -60 and 0 db

## Mode
Major = 1
Minor = -1

## Speechiness
Value between 0.0 and 1.0

The more exclusively speech-like the recording, the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.
Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. 
Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech.
Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.
